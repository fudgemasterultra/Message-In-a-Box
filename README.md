This is a template for a new project where users can hide messages for others to find, similar to a message in a bottle. To get started, please follow these steps:

1. Copy the `example.env` file and rename it to `.env`.
2. Make sure the `.env` file is located in the same directory as the `README.md` file.
3. Update the necessary environment variables in the `.env` file according to your project's requirements.
4. Cd into node and run `npm install` & `npm build`

Once you have completed these steps, you can proceed with setting up the project locally. Good luck!
